<p align="center">A Telegram bot that transcribes voice messages and summarizes them using OpenAI.</p>

---

### Synopsis

I made this because sometimes I just don't want to listen to voice messages.

This is one of countless rewrites, this time I took it as an opportunity to use [Deno v2](https://deno.com/blog/v2).

### Get started

- Message the [bot](https://t.me/fuckvoicemessages_bot)
- Send your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Send/Forward a voice message
- You'll receive a transcript, and if it's longer than 500 characters, a summary as well

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't like handing out your OpenAI key for free, then self-host the bot. Instructions TBD.
